        <h2 class="h2home">HOME PAGE</h2>

        <p class="homepage">On the home page, I used Picrew to create a cartoon version of my profile picture. The fade
            animation on the left with the title “Portfolio Website,” smoothly changes opacity using the @keyframes
            vignette-anim CSS animation. This animation makes the element fade slightly in and out by setting its
            opacity to 1 at the start and end while lowering it to 0.7 in the middle, creating this visual effect.
            The navigation bar is styled with a dark purple background and white borders (border: 2px solid white). The
            text is centered using text-align: center and displayed in a monospace font (font-family: 'Courier New',
            Courier, monospace). I removed bullet points from the list items with list-style-type: none and used
            overflow: hidden to ensure everything stays contained. To make the navigation interactive, I added a hover
            effect (.nav-links a:hover), which changes the background color to a darker shade when the user hovers over
            a link.
            For the title, I used an italic serif font with a shadow effect to make it stand out. I also added a
            transition effect (transition: 700ms ease) so that when hovered, the letter spacing and font weight change
            smoothly (letter-spacing: 1px; font-variation-settings: "wght" 582). The title bar is fixed at the top
            (position: fixed; width: 100%; z-index: 2000), ensuring it remains visible while scrolling, making
            navigation easier.
            Before starting to work on this page, I have made a visual PowerPoint slide to get an idea of how I would
            like the site to look like, making CSS styling easier.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h2contact">CONTACT PAGE</h2>

        <p class="contactpage">
            On the contact page, I kept the design consistent with the rest of the site while adding new elements for
            user interaction. The navigation bar remained the same, styled with a dark purple background and white
            borders. The title section also follows the same format, with an italic serif font, a subtle text shadow,
            and a smooth transition effect when hovered.
            To provide easy access to my contact links, I created a hyperlink list with no bullet points using the same
            technique which was used in my navigation bar. Each item is displayed inline (display: inline-block) with
            padding for spacing. The hover effect (.linklist a:hover { background-color: #33233f; }) darkens the
            background when hovering over a link to make navigating through the hyperlinks easier. I also included a
            form and messagebox, using CSS grids: (display: grid; grid-template-columns: auto 1fr;), making sure labels
            and input fields are aligned. I experimented with different border shapes (border radius), being circular,
            star and rounded edges. For the contact page I also created a PowerPoint page to get an idea of what I would
            like the CSS to turn out like.

        </p>

        <h2 class="h2project">PROJECT PAGE</h2>
        <p class="projectpage">
            Project
            I used a CSS Grid to organize the content into two columns, to arrange text and images side by side. The
            navigation bar stays consistent with the rest of the site. It’s positioned at the top with position:
            absolute; to keep it fixed in place. The main text sections (.para1, .para2, .para3) have a soft purple
            background and a solid border to stand out. I set a max-width to keep the text from stretching too wide and
            added word-wrap: break-word; so it is easier to read. Images are placed using position: absolute;, with
            specific margins to align them properly around the text. Some images are centered, while others are
            positioned to the sides for balance.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h2errors">Errors I Encountered</h2>
        <p class="errors">At first, I didn’t use CSS Grid or the
            main tag on the project page, which made organizing content and optimizing for mobile more difficult.
            Because
            of this, I had to restart the page and restructure it. After implementing Grid and main, I was able to
            make it look similar to the original design while improving layout control.
            I also hadn’t used main tags on any of the pages initially, but after adding them, everything worked
            fine. The rest of the pages didn’t require major changes, and the structure remained consistent
            across the site.
            During mobile optimization, the hamburger menu worked fine without any animations. However, when I
            added a navigation bar animation, it caused the three lines of the hamburger icon to shrink down to
            just two. This issue likely happened because the animation affected the display or height of the
            icon’s elements, causing them to overlap or disappear.
            For mobile optimization, I used a grid layout to structure the page and make it responsive. The
            navigation menu is hidden off-screen (right: -100%) and slides in when activated, creating a smooth
            transition. The hamburger icon is styled with border-top to form the lines, and I used :target to
            toggle visibility. Text and other elements are adjusted for smaller screens to improve readability
            and layout.
