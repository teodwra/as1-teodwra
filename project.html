            MODULE///Task Requirements:
            - Ask the user to enter a value of lightyears (LY)
            - Convert the entered value of LY to kilometres (KM)
            - Result displayed in the terminal/console
            - After displaying result, program should ask user if they would like to perform the operation again
            - If user agrees loop should repeat, if not the program should terminate
            - Formula for converting lightyears to kilometres is: km = ly/.000000000000010570

            Analysis:
            The conversion factor from light years to kilometers is defined by the conversion constant, km_to_ly.

            Input Loop: Requests user input repeatedly using a while True loop.

            Validation of User Input: Asks for a positive float input and determines whether it is greater than 0.

            Conversion & Output: Shows the outcome after converting light years to kilometers.

            Repeat Prompt: Inquires if the user would like to carry out the action once more. The loop repeats if "yes";
            otherwise, it terminates.

            Error Handling: Notifies the user to provide a valid number after detecting invalid inputs (numeric or ≤ 0).


            Design:
            START
            SET conversion constant km_to_ly to 0.00000000000010570
            WHILE the program keeps running:
            TRY to execute:
            TAKE INPUT from the user to enter a value for light years (as a number)
            CONVERT the user's input to a float
            IF the input is greater than 0:
            CALCULATE the corresponding kilometers by dividing lightyears by km_to_ly
            DISPLAY the result: "Lightyears to Kilometers: [kilometers]"
            ASK the user if they want to perform the operation again (yes/no)
            IF the response is no:
            BREAK the loop and terminate the program
            ELSE IF the input is less than or equal to 0:
            DISPLAY "Please enter a number greater than 0"
            CATCH an invalid input (ValueError):
            DISPLAY "Please enter a valid number"
            END

            The code below takes an input from the user for a number of light years as a float format/datatype and
            accepts it if the input is greater than 0, if it is not it asks the user to re-enter
            an input which is greater than 0 in a while loop, if the user's input is greater than 0 the input is
            accepted and the program calculates the value of kilometers by dividing the user's input
            by the set value which light years is defined. The program then asks the user if they would like to repeat
            the process with a given choice of yes or no, if the user's input is "yes" then
            the program will start again from the beginning and the loop will repeat until the condition is met, asking
            the user to enter an input of light years, if the user's input is no the program
            will terminate.
